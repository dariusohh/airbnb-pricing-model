Airbnb Pricing Model using Scikit-Learn

Personal side project to learn more about Machine Learning using Python.

The objective is to create a model which can offer a recommended listing price when an owner lists an accommodation on the market.

The model was trained and tested Airbnb Seattle data obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle.
